## Step 1: Set Up Your API Key

1. Click the ⚙️ Settings icon in the Generation Settings panel

Your API key is stored securely in your browser's local storage and is never sent to our servers.

## Step 2: Create Your First Image

1. **Choose a Model**
   - Start with "FLUX.1 Dev" for balanced quality and speed
   - Located at the top of the Generation Settings panel

2. **Enter a Prompt**

   - Example: "A serene lake at sunset, with mountains in the background, digital art style"

3. **Click Generate**
   - The blue Generate button at the bottom of the settings panel
   - Your image will appear in the gallery on the right

## Step 3: Adjust Settings (Optional)

Fine-tune your results with these settings:
- **Quality Steps**: Higher values (20-50) for more detail
- **Guidance Scale**: Higher values (7-10) for closer prompt matching
- **Output Format**: PNG for highest quality, JPEG for smaller files

## Step 4: Save Your Work

- Images are automatically saved in your browser
- Use the Image Bucket to organize favorites
- Download individual images or entire collections
