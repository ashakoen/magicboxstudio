# Quality Steps Guide

Quality Steps (also known as inference steps) control how many iterations the AI model takes to create your image. Understanding this parameter is crucial for balancing quality and generation time.

## Understanding Quality Steps

### What Are Quality Steps?

Quality steps represent the number of refinement iterations the AI performs when generating an image:
- Lower steps = Faster, rougher results
- Higher steps = Slower, more refined results
- Each step improves detail and coherence
- Diminishing returns after certain points

### Impact on Generation

1. **Detail Level**
   - More steps = More detail
   - Finer textures
   - Better coherence
   - Sharper edges

2. **Generation Time**
   - Linear relationship
   - 40 steps â‰ˆ 2x longer than 20 steps
   - Major factor in speed
   - Resource intensive

## Model-Specific Ranges

- Minimum: 20
- Recommended: 28-35
- Maximum: 50
- Sweet spot: 30

### FLUX.1 Schnell
- Minimum: 1
- Recommended: 2-3
- Maximum: 4
- Sweet spot: 3

### FLUX.1 Pro
- Minimum: 30

## Quality vs Speed

### Speed Priority
- Use Schnell model
- 20 steps or less
- Lower resolution
- Basic prompts

### Quality Priority
- Use Pro model
- 40+ steps
- Higher resolution
- Detailed prompts

### Balanced Approach
- Use Dev model
- 28-35 steps
- Standard resolution
- Normal prompts

## Advanced Techniques

### Step Optimization

1. **Start Low**
   - Begin with 20 steps
   - Check results
   - Increase if needed
   - Note improvements

2. **Find Sweet Spot**
   - Test different values
   - Document results
   - Note diminishing returns
   - Optimize for workflow

3. **Workflow Integration**
   - Match steps to phase
   - Adjust for needs
   - Balance resources
   - Monitor results

## Common Issues

### Too Few Steps

**Symptoms**
- Rough details
- Inconsistent elements
- Poor coherence
- Missing features

**Solutions**
1. Increase step count
2. Use stronger model
3. Improve prompt
4. Check resolution

### Too Many Steps

**Symptoms**
- Excessive generation time
- Resource waste
- Minimal improvement
- Workflow bottleneck

**Solutions**
1. Reduce steps
2. Use faster model
3. Optimize workflow
4. Balance settings

## Best Practices

### Workflow Optimization

1. **Development Phase**
   - Start with 20 steps
   - Quick iterations
   - Fast feedback
   - Multiple versions

2. **Refinement Phase**
   - Increase to 30-35
   - Better quality
   - More detail
   - Focused changes

3. **Final Output**
   - Use 40+ steps
   - Maximum quality
   - Full resolution
   - Perfect details

### Resource Management

1. **Time Management**
   - Match steps to deadline
   - Plan iterations
